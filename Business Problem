Toronto neighborhood classification

this project intended to use geospatial analysis in Toronto city to cluster the neighborhood of Toronto to take decision where to open new branch for retail based on previous success in one of Toronto neighborhood. The main problem for retail is accessibility. Some retails thrive by locating near each other and some retails prefer areas where there is high pedestrian footage or high vehicle traffic density.
 Through out this project we tried to cluster Toronto neighborhood by   the category of retails and entrainment facility in the neighborhood combined with the vehicles and pedestriansâ€™ traffic in that neighborhood using ten different clusters. So, the business owners from the area where direct competitors achieve success or in neighborhood where they achieved success before they  can choose new places to expand in the city from the same cluster.
